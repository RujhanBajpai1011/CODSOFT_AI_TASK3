# üìö Recommendation System

This project implements a basic **content-based recommendation system**. It suggests items (e.g., books, movies) to users based on the similarity of their descriptions using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.

## **‚ú® Features**

* **Data Processing**: Converts raw data (items with names and descriptions) into a pandas DataFrame.
* **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Transforms item descriptions into numerical TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectors, highlighting important words.
* **Similarity Calculation**: Computes the **cosine similarity** between items based on their TF-IDF representations to find how alike they are.
* **Recommendation Logic**: Recommends the top 'n' most similar items for a given item.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used**

* **Python**
* **pandas**: For data manipulation and structuring.
* **scikit-learn**:
  * `TfidfVectorizer`: To convert text data into TF-IDF features.
  * `cosine_similarity`: To calculate the similarity between item vectors.

## **üì¶ Requirements**

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

* `pandas`
* `scikit-learn`

## **üöÄ Getting Started**

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository (if applicable):**

```
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
```

2. **Install the required Python packages:**

```
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

### **Usage**

1. **Dataset (Sample Data)**: The notebook includes a `sample_data` list. You can modify this or integrate your own dataset with 'name' and 'description' fields.

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: Open and execute the cells in the `Recommendation_system.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab).

The notebook will:
* Initialize the `RecommendationSystem` with the provided data.
* Compute the TF-IDF matrix and similarity matrix.
* Print recommendations for a specified item index (e.g., `rec_sys.recommend(0)` for "Book A").
